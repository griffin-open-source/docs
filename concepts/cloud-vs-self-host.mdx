title: "Cloud vs Self-Host"
description: "Choose between Griffin Cloud and self-hosting Griffin Hub"
---

Griffin supports two deployment models. Your tests and CLI workflow are identical in both — the difference is where the hub runs.

## Griffin Cloud

Griffin Cloud is the managed platform. Sign up, authenticate with the CLI, and start deploying monitors immediately.

- **No infrastructure to manage** — we run the hub, database, and executors
- **Multi-region execution** — run tests from multiple global locations
- **Built-in integrations** — Slack, email, and webhook notifications pre-configured
- **Organizations and teams** — invite members, assign roles, manage billing
- **Always up to date** — new features and improvements ship automatically

```bash
# Authenticate with Griffin Cloud
griffin auth login

# Deploy monitors
griffin apply
```

## Self-hosted

Run Griffin Hub on your own infrastructure for full control over data, networking, and execution.

- **Data stays with you** — monitors, results, and secrets never leave your network
- **Custom locations** — run executors anywhere (your data centers, cloud regions, edge nodes)
- **Network access** — test internal APIs not exposed to the internet
- **No usage limits** — run as many monitors as your infrastructure supports

```bash
# Connect to your self-hosted hub
griffin auth connect --url https://hub.internal.example.com --token YOUR_API_KEY

# Same workflow
griffin apply
```

## Comparison

| | Griffin Cloud | Self-hosted |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Sign up and authenticate | Deploy Hub + PostgreSQL |
| **Infrastructure** | Managed | You manage |
| **Internal APIs** | Requires public endpoints | Full network access |
| **Data residency** | Griffin-managed | Your infrastructure |
| **Scaling** | Automatic | Manual (horizontal scaling supported) |
| **Authentication** | OIDC (built-in) | API keys or OIDC |
| **Cost** | Usage-based subscription | Infrastructure costs only |

## Switching between models

Since the CLI workflow is the same for both, you can switch between Cloud and self-hosted by changing your authentication:

```bash
# Switch to self-hosted
griffin auth connect --url https://your-hub.example.com --token YOUR_KEY

# Switch back to Cloud
griffin auth login
```

Your test files don't need to change. Only the hub connection changes.
