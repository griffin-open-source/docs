A run is a single execution of a monitor. Each time the scheduler triggers a monitor (or you trigger one manually), a new run is created.

## Viewing runs

```bash
# Recent runs across all monitors
griffin runs

# Runs for a specific environment
griffin runs production

# Filter by monitor
griffin runs --monitor health-check

# Show more results
griffin runs --limit 50
```

## Run details

Each run tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status** | `pending`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed` |
| **Triggered by** | `schedule` (automatic), `manual` (via CLI), or `api` |
| **Started at** | When execution began |
| **Completed at** | When execution finished |
| **Duration** | Total execution time in milliseconds |
| **Success** | Whether all assertions passed |
| **Errors** | Any error messages from failed nodes |

## Run statuses

- **Pending** — The job is queued and waiting for an executor
- **Running** — An executor is currently processing the monitor
- **Completed** — Execution finished (check `success` for pass/fail)
- **Failed** — Execution encountered an error (timeout, network failure, etc.)

## Triggering runs manually

```bash
# Trigger a run
griffin run --monitor my-test

# Trigger and wait for results
griffin run --monitor my-test --wait

# Trigger in a specific environment
griffin run production --monitor my-test
```

Manual runs execute immediately regardless of the monitor's frequency schedule.
