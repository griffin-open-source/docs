## Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g griffin-cli
```

After installation, verify it works:

```bash
griffin --version
```

## Use without installing

Run any Griffin command with `npx`:

```bash
npx griffin-cli test
```

## Initialize a project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
griffin init
```

This creates a `griffin.json` configuration file in your project root. Griffin uses this to identify the project and track environments.

<Tip>
Griffin discovers test files in `__griffin__/` directories anywhere in your project tree. You can organize tests alongside the code they test.
</Tip>

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **npm** 8 or later
- A `__griffin__/` directory containing `.ts` test files
