## 1. Install and initialize

```bash
npm install -g @griffin-app/griffin
griffin init
```

## 2. Create a monitor file

Create a `__griffin__/` directory and add a monitor file:

```bash
mkdir -p __griffin__
```

Create `__griffin__/health-check.ts`:

```typescript
import { createMonitorBuilder, GET, Json, Assert, Frequency } from "@griffin-app/griffin";

const monitor = createMonitorBuilder({
  name: "health-check",
  frequency: Frequency.every(1).minute(),
})
  .request("check", {
    method: GET,
    base: "https://api.example.com",
    response_format: Json,
    path: "/health",
  })
  .assert((state) => [
    Assert(state["check"].status).equals(200),
  ])
  .build();

export default monitor;
```

Replace `https://api.example.com` with your API's URL.

## 3. Run locally

```bash
griffin test
```

Griffin discovers all monitor files in `__griffin__/` directories and executes them. You'll see the results for each monitor — which requests were made, whether assertions passed, and timing information.

## 4. Deploy to the hub

Once your monitors are working locally, deploy them for continuous monitoring:

```bash
# Authenticate (Cloud)
griffin auth login

# Or connect to a self-hosted hub
griffin auth connect --url https://your-hub.example.com --token YOUR_TOKEN

# Preview what will change
griffin plan

# Deploy
griffin apply
```

Your monitors are now running on a schedule. View results with:

```bash
griffin runs
griffin metrics
```
