Organizations in Griffin Cloud support role-based access control. Each member is assigned a role that determines what they can do.

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access — manage members, billing, integrations, and all monitors |
| **Member** | Can deploy monitors, view runs and metrics, manage secrets and variables |

## Inviting members

Admins can invite new members from the web dashboard:

1. Navigate to your organization settings
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter their email address and select a role
4. They'll receive an invitation email with a link to join

## Managing members

Admins can:
- View all organization members
- Change a member's role
- Remove members from the organization

## Authentication

Griffin Cloud supports multiple authentication methods:
- **Email and password**
- **OAuth providers** (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Magic link** (passwordless email login)

For CLI authentication, use `griffin auth login` which starts a device authorization flow in your browser.
