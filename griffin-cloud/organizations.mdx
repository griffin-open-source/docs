Organizations are the top-level unit in Griffin Cloud. All monitors, runs, metrics, secrets, and integrations are scoped to an organization.

## Creating an organization

When you first sign up for Griffin Cloud, you'll be guided through creating an organization. You can also create additional organizations later from the web dashboard.

## Switching organizations

If you belong to multiple organizations, your session tracks which organization is currently active. All CLI commands operate within the context of your active organization.

## Organization scope

Everything in Griffin Cloud is scoped to your organization:

- **Monitors** — Deployed tests belong to the organization
- **Environments** — Each organization has its own environments
- **Secrets** — Stored per-organization, per-environment
- **Integrations** — Slack, email, and webhook connections are per-organization
- **Members** — Users are invited to specific organizations
- **Billing** — Usage is tracked and billed per-organization

## Inviting members

Invite team members from the web dashboard. Each member is assigned a role that determines their permissions. See [Members & Roles](/griffin-cloud/members-roles) for details.
