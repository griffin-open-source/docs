Griffin Cloud billing is managed per-organization through the web dashboard.

## Managing billing

Access billing settings from your organization's settings page in the web dashboard. From there you can:

- View your current plan
- Update payment methods
- View usage and invoices

## Open source alternative

Griffin is open source. If you prefer to manage your own infrastructure, you can [self-host Griffin Hub](/griffin-hub/self-hosting) at no cost. The CLI and test authoring experience is identical.
