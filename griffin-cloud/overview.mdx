Griffin Cloud is the managed version of Griffin. It runs the hub, database, executors, and web dashboard so you can focus on writing tests.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g griffin-cli

# Authenticate with Griffin Cloud
griffin auth login

# Initialize your project
griffin init

# Deploy monitors
griffin apply
```

The `griffin auth login` command opens a browser-based authentication flow. Once authenticated, the CLI stores your credentials locally and all subsequent commands communicate with Griffin Cloud.

## What's included

- **Hosted hub** — Monitors, scheduling, and results storage are fully managed
- **Multi-region executors** — Run tests from multiple global locations
- **Web dashboard** — View monitors, runs, metrics, and alerts in a browser
- **Organizations** — Collaborate with your team (see [Organizations](/griffin-cloud/organizations))
- **Built-in integrations** — Slack, email, and webhook notifications
- **Automatic updates** — New features ship without any action on your part

## CLI workflow

The CLI workflow is identical to self-hosted. The only difference is how you authenticate:

```bash
# Griffin Cloud
griffin auth login

# Self-hosted
griffin auth connect --url https://hub.example.com --token YOUR_KEY
```

All other commands (`plan`, `apply`, `runs`, `metrics`, etc.) work the same way.
