## What is Griffin?

Griffin is an open-source project that allows developers to create API tests with code and run those tests against their production APIs. It's like Datadog Synthetics, but it lives in your codebase.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple API test written with Griffin:

```typescript
import { GET, ApiCheckBuilder, JSON, START, END, Frequency } from "griffin-test-system";

const builder = new ApiCheckBuilder({
  name: "health-check",
  endpoint_host: "http://localhost:3000"
});

const plan = builder
  .addEndpoint("health", { 
    method: GET, 
    response_format: JSON, 
    path: "/health" 
  })
  .addEdge(START, "health")
  .addEdge("health", END);

plan.create({ frequency: Frequency.every(1).minute() });
```
