## What is Griffin?

Griffin is an open-source platform for writing API monitors in TypeScript and running them continuously against your production APIs. Write monitors as code, deploy them to a hub, and get notified when things break.

```typescript
import { createMonitorBuilder, GET, Json, Assert, Frequency } from "@griffin-app/griffin";

const monitor = createMonitorBuilder({
  name: "health-check",
  frequency: Frequency.every(1).minute(),
})
  .request("check", {
    method: GET,
    base: "https://api.example.com",
    response_format: Json,
    path: "/health",
  })
  .assert((state) => [
    Assert(state["check"].status).equals(200),
    Assert(state["check"].latency).lessThan(2000),
  ])
  .build();

export default monitor;
