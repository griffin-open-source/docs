## What is Griffin?

Griffin is an open-source project that allows developers to create API tests with code and run those tests against their production APIs. It's like Datadog Synthetics, but it lives in your codebase.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple API test written with Griffin:

```typescript
import { createTestBuilder, GET, JSON, Assert, Frequency } from "griffin-ts";

const monitor = createTestBuilder({
  name: "health-check",
  endpoint_host: "http://localhost:3000"
})
  .endpoint("health", {
    method: GET,
    response_format: JSON,
    path: "/health"
  })
  .assert((state) => [
    Assert(state["health"].status).equals(200)
  ])
  .build({ frequency: Frequency.every(1).minute() });

export default monitor;
```
