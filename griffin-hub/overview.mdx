description: "The control plane for Griffin's API monitoring"
---

Griffin Hub is the backend service that stores monitors, schedules runs, processes results, and serves the API. It's what the CLI communicates with when you run `griffin apply`, `griffin runs`, or `griffin metrics`.

## What the hub does

- **Stores monitors** — Receives and persists test definitions from the CLI
- **Schedules execution** — Triggers monitors based on their configured frequency
- **Processes results** — Stores run outcomes and aggregates metrics
- **Manages secrets** — Resolves secret references at execution time
- **Sends notifications** — Evaluates notification rules and dispatches alerts
- **Serves the API** — Provides REST endpoints for the CLI and integrations

## Deployment modes

### Standalone

The hub runs with a built-in executor in a single process. This is the simplest setup:

```bash
cd griffin-hub
npm run start:standalone
```

One process handles everything: API, scheduling, and test execution.

### Distributed

The hub runs as a control plane only, with separate executor agents:

```bash
# Start the hub (control plane only)
cd griffin-hub
npm start

# Start agents separately (can be on different machines)
# Agents register with the hub and pull jobs from the queue
```

This mode supports multiple executors in different locations for geographic distribution and horizontal scaling.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+
- **PostgreSQL** 14+ (for storage and job queue)
- Appropriate environment variables (see [Configuration](/griffin-hub/configuration))

## Quick start

```bash
# Set up the database
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/griffin"
cd griffin-hub
npm run db:push

# Start in standalone mode
npm run start:standalone
```
