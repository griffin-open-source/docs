title: "Frequencies & Scheduling"
description: "Control how often your monitors run"
---

Every monitor has a frequency that determines how often the hub schedules it for execution.

## Setting a frequency

Frequency is a required field in both builders:

```typescript
import { Frequency } from "griffin-ts";

createTestBuilder({
  name: "health-check",
  frequency: Frequency.every(5).minutes(),
})
```

## Available intervals

```typescript
Frequency.every(1).minute()    // Every minute
Frequency.every(5).minutes()   // Every 5 minutes
Frequency.every(15).minutes()  // Every 15 minutes

Frequency.every(1).hour()      // Every hour
Frequency.every(6).hours()     // Every 6 hours

Frequency.every(1).day()       // Every day
Frequency.every(7).days()      // Every 7 days
```

Both singular and plural forms work: `.minute()` and `.minutes()` are equivalent.

## How scheduling works

The hub's scheduler runs on a tick interval (default: 30 seconds). On each tick, it checks which monitors are due based on their frequency and last execution time, then enqueues jobs for execution.

- A monitor with `Frequency.every(1).minute()` will be scheduled approximately every 60 seconds
- The scheduler ensures no duplicate jobs are created for the same monitor within its frequency window
- If an executor is unavailable, jobs queue up and execute when an executor becomes available

## Choosing a frequency

| Frequency | Good for |
|-----------|----------|
| Every 1 minute | Critical health checks, payment APIs, auth endpoints |
| Every 5 minutes | Important API endpoints, core business flows |
| Every 15 minutes | Standard monitoring, CRUD operations |
| Every 1 hour | Low-priority checks, third-party API status |
| Every 1 day | Periodic validation, data integrity checks |

<Note>
Higher frequencies mean more executions, which affects resource usage on self-hosted deployments and costs on Griffin Cloud.

## Locations

Optionally specify where your monitor should execute. In distributed mode, jobs are routed to executors running in the specified locations:

```typescript
createTestBuilder({
  name: "global-check",
  frequency: Frequency.every(5).minutes(),
  locations: ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"],
})
```

When locations are specified, the scheduler creates separate jobs for each location on each run. If no locations are specified, the monitor runs on any available executor.
