description: "Environment-scoped API operations"
---

Environments are used as a filter across most Griffin Hub API endpoints. There is no dedicated environments CRUD API — environments are implicitly created when you deploy monitors to them.

## Using environments in API calls

Most endpoints accept an `environment` query parameter or body field to scope operations:

### Monitors

```bash
# List monitors for a specific environment
curl "https://hub.example.com/monitor?projectId=my-project&environment=production" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
```

### Metrics

```bash
# Get metrics for a specific environment
curl "https://hub.example.com/metrics/summary?environment=production&period=day" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "period": "day",
  "periodStart": "2025-01-14T10:00:00Z",
  "periodEnd": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "monitors": {
    "total": 5,
    "passing": 4,
    "failing": 1,
    "noRecentRuns": 0
  },
  "runs": {
    "total": 1200,
    "successful": 1180,
    "failed": 20,
    "successRate": 98.3
  },
  "latency": {
    "p50": 120,
    "p95": 450,
    "p99": 1200
  },
  "uptimePercent": 98.3,
  "failingMonitors": [
    {
      "monitorId": "mon_abc123",
      "name": "payment-flow",
      "lastFailure": "2025-01-15T09:45:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Secrets

```bash
# List secrets for an environment
curl "https://hub.example.com/secrets?environment=production" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"

# Set a secret in an environment
curl -X PUT "https://hub.example.com/secrets/API_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "value": "sk-1234...", "environment": "production" }'
```

### Integrations

```bash
# List integrations for an environment
curl "https://hub.example.com/integrations?environment=production" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
```

## Locations

Get available executor locations:

```bash
curl "https://hub.example.com/locations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "us-east-1",
    "queueName": "us-east",
    "displayName": "US East (N. Virginia)"
  },
  {
    "id": "eu-west-1",
    "queueName": "eu-west",
    "displayName": "EU West (Ireland)"
  }
]
```
