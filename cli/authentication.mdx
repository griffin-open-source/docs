title: "Authentication"
description: "Connect the CLI to Griffin Cloud or a self-hosted hub"
---

The CLI needs to authenticate with a hub before you can deploy monitors or view results.

## Griffin Cloud

```bash
griffin auth login
```

Opens a browser-based device authorization flow. Once you authenticate, credentials are stored locally and used for all subsequent commands.

```bash
griffin auth logout
```

Clears stored credentials.

## Self-hosted hub

```bash
griffin auth connect --url https://hub.example.com --token YOUR_API_KEY
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--url <url>` | Hub URL (required) |
| `--token <token>` | API authentication token |

The hub URL and token are stored in your project's local state.

## Generating API keys

For self-hosted hubs using API key authentication:

```bash
griffin auth generate-key
```

Generates a key in the format `grfn_sk_<48-char-hex>`. Configure this key on the hub via the `AUTH_API_KEYS` environment variable.

## Checking connection status

```bash
griffin status
```

Shows your current project, connected hub, and authentication state.
